## OutWatch is declarative

OutWatch combines functional and reactive programming to enable you to build performant web applications using pure functions.

You won't see any imperative calls like `dispatch` or `setState`.
Declarative code makes your app easier to reason about and more predictable, allowing you peace of mind.

## Simple components

In OutWatch components are just functions, no boilerplate necessary.
Reactive Programming allows us to create fully self-responsible components that never touch external state.

No more wondering where an action or a change in state came from.
Components are fully decoupled and therefore extremely reusable.
