A Sink is something that takes event values and somehow processes them.

If we call one of the `createHandler` functions, we're actually creating both an Observable and a Sink.
We can use the `createHandler` with any type to create a new `Observable with Sink` for any type we want, e.g:
{% highlight scala %}
createHandler[Seq[String]]
{% endhighlight %}

`Observable with Sink` is actually implemented with Subjects under the hood,
but don't expose the `next` or `completed` functions,
which are usually used when one doesn't understand how to solve something the reactive way.


## Creating your own Sinks

Defining your own Sinks is pretty easy. You might want to do this if you need to talk to some kind of external library for example.

The easiest way to do this is to use the `Sink.create` function:
{% highlight scala %}
def create[T](onNext: T => Unit): Sink[T]
{% endhighlight %}

`create` takes a function as its parameter that will be executed every time the Sink receives an emitted value.
For example if we wanted to send messages to a WebSocket, we could create a Sink for that as simple as this:
{% highlight scala %}
val socketSink = Sink.create[String](msg => socket.send(msg))
{% endhighlight %}

Now that we have this Sink we could use it like any other Sink, e.g:

{% highlight scala %}
div(
  input(tpe := "text", inputString --> socketSink)
)
{% endhighlight %}

This would send a message to our WebSocket on every change to our text field, so it's probably not something we'd encounter in any real application, but it's fine for demonstrating how this works.
