A Sink is something that takes event values and somehow processes them.

If we call one of the `createHandler` functions, we're actually creating both an Observable and a Sink.

<div class="lang-specific scala" markdown="1">
We can use the `createHandler` with any type to create a new `Observable with Sink` for any type we want, e.g:
{% include switch-tab-widget.html %}
{% highlight scala %}
val handler = createHandler[Seq[String]]()
{% endhighlight %}

`Observable with Sink` is actually implemented with Subjects under the hood,
but don't expose the `next` or `completed` functions,
which are usually used when one doesn't understand how to solve something the reactive way.

<div class="lang-specific purescript" markdown="1">
We can use the `createHandler` with any type to create a new Handler for any type we want, e.g:
{% include switch-tab-widget.html %}
{% highlight scala %}
let handler = createHandler[]
{% endhighlight %}

You can choose to use the `createHandler` function to let the type checker infer the type for you, or go for one of the more specific functions like `createStringHandler` to specify the type up front.

## Creating your own Sinks

Defining your own Sinks is pretty easy. You might want to do this if you need to talk to some kind of external library for example.

The easiest way to do this is to use the `Sink.create` function:
{% include switch-tab-widget.html %}
<div class="lang-specific scala">
{% highlight scala %}
def create[T](onNext: T => Unit): Sink[T]
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="lang-specific purescript">
{% highlight haskell %}
create :: forall a e. (a -> Eff e Unit) -> Sink e a
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

<span class="lang-specific scala">`create` takes a function as its parameter that will be executed every time the Sink receives an emitted value.</span>
<span class="lang-specific purescript">`create` takes an effect as its parameter that will be executed every time the Sink receives an emitted value. The resulting expression is not of type `VDom e`, where e is the effect type of the `Eff` that was passed to `create`.</span>
For example if we wanted to send messages to a WebSocket, we could create a Sink for that as simple as this:
{% include switch-tab-widget.html %}
<div class="lang-specific scala">
{% highlight scala %}
val socketSink = Sink.create[String](msg => socket.send(msg))
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="lang-specific purescript">
{% highlight haskell %}
socketSink :: forall e. Sink (ws :: WS | e) String
socketSink = Sink.create (\msg -> send socket msg)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Now that we have this Sink we could use it like any other Sink, e.g:

<div class="lang-specific scala">
{% highlight scala %}
div(
  input(tpe := "text", inputString --> socketSink)
)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="lang-specific purescript">
{% highlight haskell %}
socketComponent :: forall e. VDom (ws :: WS | e)
socketComponent =
  div [ input[ inputString ==> socketSink ] ]
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

This would send a message to our WebSocket on every change to our text field, so it's probably not something we'd encounter in any real application, but it's fine for demonstrating how this works.

{% include switch-tab-sources.html %}
