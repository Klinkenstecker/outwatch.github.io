HTTP is an integral part of almost any web app. OutWatch tries to make it as easy as possible to dispatch HTTP requests, while retaining the reactive and functional paradigm.

Let's look at the api for the simplest type of HTTP request, the GET-request:
{% include switch-tab-widget.html %}
<div class="lang-specific scala">
{% highlight scala %}
def get(urls: Observable[String]): Observable[Response]
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="lang-specific purescript">
{% highlight haskell %}
get :: forall e a. (Observable a -> Observable Url) -> HttpBus (ajax :: AJAX | e) a
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="lang-specific purescript" markdown="1">
This function takes a function from `Observable a` to `Observable Url` and returns a `HttpBus` of `a` with the effect type `AJAX`.
An `HttpBus` has a `responses` field, which is an Observable of the results of a HTTP call, an `Observable` that emits the responses to an HTTP request.
We can then bind the `responses` Observable of the bus to our view.

The `HttpBus` also has a field called `sink`, which is a `Sink` of `a`.
Therefore it also acts like `SinkLike` and can be used with event emitters such as `click`, by using the left facing arrow `==>`.

We will need to pass a function that turns an `Observable a`, which would be a `MouseEvent`, if we used `click`, into an `Observable URL`. In our context, `Url` is just a type alias for String. Let's look at a small example of how we could use the `get` function:

{% include switch-tab-widget.html %}
{% highlight haskell %}
let bus = Http.get (mapTo "http://someurl.org")
    root = button[click ==> bus]
{% endhighlight %}

Here we just map every click to an Http request to our given url.

Now it's time to look at a more concrete example, in which we have a search field and want to access some external API and display the result.

</div>
<div class="lang-specific scala" markdown="1">
This function takes a stream of URLs as Strings and returns a stream of HTTP `Response`s.
This way everytime the original stream emits a URL, an HTTP request will be sent to the given URL and emit the response on the returned stream.

Let's look at a small example, in which we have a search field and want to access some external API and display the result.
</div>

{% include switch-tab-widget.html %}
<div class="lang-specific scala">
{% highlight scala %}
val queries = createStringHandler()

val requests = queries
  .map(query => s"https://someurl.org?query=$query")
  .debounceTime(300 millis)
  .retry(4)

val responses = Http.get(requests)
  .map(_.body)

val root = div(
  input(inputString --> queries),
  span(child <-- responses)
)

OutWatch.render("#app", root)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="lang-specific purescript">
{% highlight haskell %}
let queries = Http.get (
          map (\query -> "https://someurl.org?query=" <> query)
      >>> debounceTime 300
      >>> retry 4
    )
    responses = queries.responses
      # map (_.body)

    root = div
      [ input[inputString ==> queries]
      , span[childShow <== responses]
      ]

in OutWatch.render "#app" root
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Here we use the `debounceTime` operator, so that we only get the latest values of our search field within a 300 ms time window.
Additionally we also use `retry`, so that in the case that our Http Request fails, it will automatically retry the request up to 4 times.
Then we map our response stream to the body of the HTTP response and show it inside of a `span`.

It's important here to understand that the response stream emits *after* the HTTP request is completed<span class="lang-specific scala" markdown="1">, while the request stream emits *before* the HTTP request is complete</span>.


### Other HTTP methods

The previous function for GET-requests works well, because usually, our GET-requests don't have any bodies. POST-, PUT- or the other HTTP requests usually have some kind of data in JSON or XML inside their bodies.

That's why, for all of our HTTP verbs (GET included) we have this kind of function:
{% include switch-tab-widget.html %}
<div class="lang-specific scala">
{% highlight scala %}
def post(requests: Observable[Request]): Observable[Response]
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="lang-specific purescript">
{% highlight haskell %}
post :: forall e a. (Observable a -> Observable Request) -> HttpBus (ajax :: AJAX | e) a
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
The HTTP `Request` type has all the parameters you'd expect when dispatching HTTP requests.

<div class="lang-specific purescript" markdown="1">
We can use the `request` function to create a `Request` record with a Url and a body:

{% highlight haskell %}
request :: Url -> String -> Request
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Now, as an example, let's create a simple app to dispatch POST-requests.

{% include switch-tab-widget.html %}
<div class="lang-specific scala">
{% highlight scala %}
val url = "https://someurl.org/people"

val people = createStringHandler()
val clicks = createStringHandler()

val requests = clicks
  .map(person => Request(url, person))

val responses = Http.post(requests)
  .mapTo(1)
  .scan(0)(_ + _)
  .map(_ + " responses received!")

val root = div(
  input(inputString --> people),
  button(click(people) --> clicks, "POST"),
  span(child <-- responses)
)

OutWatch.render("#app", root)
{% endhighlight %}
</div>
<div class="lang-specific purescript">
{% highlight haskell %}
let url = "https://someurl.org/people"

    people = createStringHandler[]
    requests = Http.post
      (map (\person -> request url person))


    responses = requests.responses
      # mapTo 1
      # scan (+) 0
      # map (\n -> (show n) <> " responses received!")

    root = div
      [ input[inputString ==> people]
      , button[override click people.src ==> requests, text "POST"]
      , span[childShow <== responses]
      ]

in OutWatch.render "#app" root
{% endhighlight %}
</div>

Whenever we click the button, this app dispatches a POST-request, with the text of our text field as it's body.
It then gathers the amount of responses received and displays them in a `span`. This example demonstrates how to send a POST-request, but the same pattern can be used to create GET, PUT, DELETE or any other HTTP request.
